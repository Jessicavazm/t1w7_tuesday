# Pseudocode
- Plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or a program.
- Bridge between the program's logic and the actual code.

## Importance
- Helps to understand and plan the program logic, so it's easier to code.
- Improves collaborations in team projects.
- Helps with trouble-shooting.
- Identify the core areas of the programming that needs to be done

## Characteristics
- Plain language: Simple and understandable
- Structured: Follows proper logic sequence
- Abstracted: Focuses on logic more than the syntax
- Detailed: Thorough walkthrough that helps explain the logic

## Basic Constructs

- Sequential 
``` 
    Step 1: Do this
    Step 2: Do that
```

- Conditional

```
    IF condition matches THEN
        Do something
    ELSE
        Do something else
    END IF                
```

- Loops
```
    WHILE conditon meets
        Do something
    END WHILE = using exit statements
```

```
    FOR EACH item in a collection
        Do something
    END FOR    
```

- Practical examples

- Example 1: Calculating the sum of a list of numbers [1,2,3,4,5]
```
Initialise sum to zero
FOR each number in the list
    ADD the number to sum
END FOR
Print sum
```

- Finding the maximum number in a list
```
    Initialise the max to the first number of the list
    FOR each number in the list:
        IF number is greather than max THEN 
            Set max to number
        END IF
    END FOR
    Print max        
```
